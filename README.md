# opam-wix

[opam-wix](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-wix) is a Cygwin plugin for [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/), the OCaml package manager. This plugin provides integration with the [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/), allowing you to create Windows Installer packages (MSI) for your OCaml applications and packages.

The resulting MSI package generated by opam-wix is a portable installer that can be used on any Windows machine with the main disk labeled as "C:". This means you can distribute the generated MSI package to users or deploy it on different machines without restrictions.

## Features

- Generate Windows Installer packages (MSI) for OCaml applications from your environement.
- Define installation directories, shortcuts, and registry keys.
- Integration with opam, leveraging its package metadata and dependency resolution.

## Installation

To install the opam-wix plugin, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install opam
First, make sure you have opam installed.

If not, the easiest way is to install it via cygwin: package `ocaml`, `opam` and `gcc-g++` for mccs. In the next version of opam, there will be cygwin depexts handling, you'lle no more need to install it manually. You can run this command to install everything, don't forget to replace `c:\\cygwin64` by your Cygwin root:
```bash
setupx86-64 --root C:\\cygwin64 --quite-mode --no-desktop --no-adminmenu --no-startmenu --packages=ocaml,opam,gcc-g++
```
Then you can initialise your opam with the default repository.
```bash
opam init
```

#### 2. Install Wix toolset
* Install [Wix toolset](https://wixtoolset.org) (stable version =< 3.11) and set installation path (often in Program Files) in variable:
```bash
export WIXPATH='/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/<your installation directory>'
```
* Check that you have the tool `uuidgen`, otherwise install `util-linux` Cygwin package.

#### 3. Install the plugin
```bash
opam pin https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-wix.git
```

## Usage

To generate MSI file for the executable installed by `pkg` run:

```bash
opam wix pkg
```

To generate MSI file for an executable `bin` within package `pkg` run:

```bash
opam wix pkg --binary bin --wix-path $WIXPATH
```

To generate MSI file for an executable from the file system `bin-path` boxed in `pkg`, run:

```bash
opam wix pkg --binary-path bin-path --wix-path $WIXPATH
```

For customize interface purpose you can override some default graphic components like main icon :
```bash
opam wix pkg --binary bin --wix-path $WIXPATH --ico new/path/to/icon
```

**Note**:
- Chosen executable shouldn't be a script!
- Since `WIXPATH` often contains spaces, it is fine if program prints the warning about it.

           binary with the same name.

       --bp=PATH, --binary-path=PATH
           The path to the binary file to handle

OTHER OPTIONS
       --ban-bmp=FILE
           BMP file that is used as background for banner for installer.

       --dlg-bmp=FILE

## Installer

Final installer GUI consists of three component :

**The Welcome page** serves as the initial step when running the installer. It provides essential information about the package-executable pair that you are about to install.

**Installation Options.** During the installation process, you will be presented with various options to customize the installation according to your preferences. The Installation Options section allows you to make the following choices:

1. **Path Selection:** You have the flexibility to choose the desired path on your Windows system where you want to install the executable.

2. **Shortcut Creation:** You can decide whether you want shortcuts to be created for the installed software. You have two choices:

   - **Desktop:** Selecting this option will create a shortcut icon on your desktop.

   - **Start Menu:** By choosing this option, a shortcut to the software will be added to the Start Menu.

3. **`PATH` Environment Variable:** You can choose whether or not to add the path to the installed binary in the `PATH` environment variable. On uninstall, the installer will remove the path to the installed binary from the `PATH` variable.
